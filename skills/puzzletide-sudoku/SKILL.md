# PuzzleTide Sudoku

Generate, solve, and validate sudoku with the local PuzzleTide CLI.

**Never generate or solve a sudoku by hand.** Hand-made puzzles usually have
multiple solutions or none; hand-solving is slow and error-prone. The CLI
verifies every generated puzzle has exactly one solution, and its solver is
instant.

Prefer the local CLI. Check availability in this order:

```bash
ptide --version
puzzletide --version
npx puzzletide --version
```

If none of those work, ask the user before installing (`npm install -g puzzletide`).

## Grid format

81 characters, row by row; digits 1-9 are givens, `.` / `0` / `_` are empty.
Whitespace and separators are ignored on input.

## Generate

```bash
ptide sudoku generate --difficulty hard            # easy | medium | hard | expert
ptide sudoku generate --seed 42 --pdf sudoku.pdf   # printable with solution page
ptide run puzzle.sudoku.generate --difficulty expert --json
```

## Solve

```bash
ptide sudoku solve "53..7....6..195....98....6.8...6...34..8.3..17...2...6.6....28....419..5....8..79"
ptide sudoku solve --file puzzle.txt --json
```

The solver also reports whether the solution is unique.

## Validate (is this a proper sudoku?)

```bash
ptide sudoku validate --file puzzle.txt --json
```

Reports conflicts among givens, solvability, and solution uniqueness. Use this
to check user-provided puzzles before solving, or to verify a candidate answer
grid follows the rules.

## Daily puzzle

```bash
ptide daily        # same medium puzzle for everyone on a given UTC day
```

## Safety

- Everything runs locally; no account, API key, or network access.
- Do not install packages without asking the user first.
