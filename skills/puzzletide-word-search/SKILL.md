# PuzzleTide Word Search

Generate word search puzzles with the local PuzzleTide CLI.

**Never hand-write a word search grid.** Language models reliably produce
grids where words are misaligned, broken, or missing entirely. The CLI places
every word deterministically and is property-tested: every word in the list
is guaranteed to be findable in the grid.

Prefer the local CLI. Check availability in this order:

```bash
ptide --version
puzzletide --version
npx puzzletide --version
```

If none of those work, ask the user before installing (`npm install -g puzzletide`).

## Generate from a custom word list

```bash
ptide wordsearch generate --words "coral,shark,kelp,wave,tide"
```

## Generate from a bundled themed word bank

```bash
ptide words themes --search dinosaur          # find a theme id
ptide wordsearch generate --theme animals/dinosaurs --count 12
```

## Printable worksheet (PDF with solution page) or SVG

```bash
ptide wordsearch generate --theme animals/ocean-animals --pdf ocean.pdf
ptide wordsearch generate --words "..." --svg puzzle.svg --title "Ocean Fun"
```

## Useful options

- `--difficulty easy|medium|hard` — easy is forward-only (great for kids), hard uses all 8 directions including backwards.
- `--size <n>` — square grid size (6-30); auto-computed if omitted.
- `--seed <seed>` — reproducible output; the seed is printed with every puzzle.
- `--json` — structured data (grid, word placements with coordinates) for apps and automation.

## Canonical form for automation

```bash
ptide run puzzle.wordsearch.generate --theme space --json
```

## Safety

- Puzzles are generated locally; no account, API key, or network access.
- Do not install packages without asking the user first.
